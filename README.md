### What Stomach Savior does?

I observe an interesting scenario: many CMU students use WeChat (Chinese equivalent of WhatsApp) to order food from nearby Chinese restaurants. Every student should be in several groups, that's how they can know what's todays' menu, and choose their favorite. For restaurants, they have to count orders one by one, to know how many students order the food.

Stomach Savior is to make it more efficient!!

### Basic funtionalities

For students:

- See today's menu (with comments) by all registered merchants.
- Place and delete orders.
- Get notification about food delivery (time, location).
- Add comments to orders.
- Get recommendation on food.

For merchants:

- Post and edit today's menu (with images).
- Add descriptive profile.
- Manage order numbers and other information (preferred delivered time, pick-up location).
- Send notification to students.
- Get feedback from customers.

### Advanced functionalities

- If one buy more than he needs, he can re-sell it on food exchange platform.

### To do
